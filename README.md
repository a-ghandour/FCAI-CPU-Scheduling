# FCAI CPU Scheduling

## Overview

This project is a Java-based simulation of various CPU scheduling algorithms, developed as part of the Operating Systems course at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence (FCAI). It aims to clearly understand how different scheduling strategies manage process execution in a CPU.

## Features

* **Implemented Algorithms**:

  * First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  * Shortest Job First (SJF)
  * Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  * Round Robin (RR)
  * Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
  * Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
  * Feedback Scheduling
  * Aging

* **Simulation Capabilities**:

  * Process arrival and burst time handling
  * Priority levels for applicable algorithms
  * Time quantum management for Round Robin
  * Gantt chart visualization of process scheduling
  * Calculation of performance metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and response time

## Usage

Upon running the application, follow the on-screen prompts to:

* Select a scheduling algorithm
* Input process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.)
* View the scheduling simulation and performance metrics
